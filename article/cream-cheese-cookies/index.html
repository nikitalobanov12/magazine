			<h2>Hi Bold Bakers!</h2>
			<p>
				<strong>WHY YOU&apos;LL LOVE THIS RECIPE:</strong> Our Cream
				Cheese Chocolate Chip Cookies Recipe delivers delectably soft,
				thick cookies with a mild tang that perfectly sets off the
				chunks of bittersweet chocolate. The best news is that you
				don&apos;t have to wait long to sink your teeth into one of
				these luscious treats! This speedy recipe takes just a little
				over 30 minutes.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Immaculate texture:</strong> This recipe is ideal if you
				prefer plump chocolate chip cookies and cream cheese in one
				bite. The cream cheese helps make a delightfully thick dough
				that gives this cookie a satisfying heft and velvety crumb.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Layers of irresistible flavor:</strong> The added cream
				cheese gives these cookies a luxurious, rich taste that is not
				overpowering. Instead, it beautifully accents the
				molasses-tinged brown sugar and bittersweet chocolate.
				Additionally, the subtle tang of cream cheese adds another
				dimension that yields a baked good with more interest and
				sophistication than the average chocolate chip cookie.
			</p>
			<p>
				Mixing cream cheese into a dough or batter is a delicious
				technique that imparts moisture, gorgeously tender texture, and
				that iconic zip of cream cheese flavor. After making this dreamy
				chocolate chip cream cheese cookie, try our

				What are Cream Cheese Chocolate Chip Cookies?
			</h2>
			<img
				src="/images/Choco-Chip-Cream-Cheese-Cookies.webp"
				alt="Cocolate chip cream cheese cookies"
			/>
			<p>
				<strong>Cream Cheese Chocolate Chip Cookies</strong> are a soft,
				cakey type of chocolate chip cookie that&apos;s packed with
				chopped bittersweet chocolate.
			</p>
			<p>
				This recipe is made with a quarter cup of cream cheese. Adding
				cream cheese to the dough elevates the texture by contributing
				moisture and richness. Since the amount of cream cheese is
				small, it doesn&apos;t overwhelm the taste of the cookie but
				gives the cookies a pleasant, mild tang.
			</p>
			<p>
				The smooth, thick cream cheese we have today was developed by
				dairy farmer William Lawrence in 1872, who branded it
				&ldquo;Philadelphia Cream Cheese.&rdquo; Early on, it was used
				to make American-style cheesecakes, and later, it became a
				popular ingredient in pound cakes and quick bread because of the
				moisture and plushness it added to baked goods.

				<strong>Make it Bolder!</strong> Bittersweet chocolate is my
				favorite for these cookies, but feel free to use your favorite
				chocolate or a mix of milk, bittersweet, and semi-sweet
				chocolate chips!

			<h2 id="key-ingredients-and-why">Key Ingredients and Why</h2>
			<img
				src="/images/key ingredients.webp"
				alt="key ingredients, granulated sugar, cream cheese, egg, baking soda, vanilla extract, dark brown sugar, cornstarch, all purpose flour, salt, butter, chocolate"
			/>

			<h3>All-purpose flour</h3>
			<p>
				With a protein content of 9-11%, all-purpose flour gives these
				chocolate chip cream cheese cookies enough structure to hold
				their shape while still having a wonderfully soft texture.
			</p>

			<h3>Cornstarch</h3>
			<p>
				Cornstarch contributes to the soft, velvety mouthfeel of the
				cookies. Because cornstarch breaks down some of the flour&apos;s
				protein, it helps make the cookie tender.
			</p>
			<p>
				Additionally, cornstarch helps inhibit spreading by absorbing
				some of the moisture from the dough. This results in thicker,
				soft cookies with crisp edges.
			</p>

			<h3>Baking soda</h3>
			<p>
				Baking soda is a leavening agent that makes these cream cheese
				chocolate cookies puffier.
			</p>
			<p>
				Read our post
				<a href="/how-to-make-baking-powder-and-baking-soda-explained"
					>How to Make Baking Powder and Baking Soda Explained</a
				>
				and learn how to make these kitchen staples yourself!
			</p>

			<h3>Salt</h3>
			<p>
				Salt accents the bittersweet chocolate wonderfully and keeps the
				cookies from being overly sweet.
			</p>

			<h3>Butter</h3>
			<p>
				Using butter with cream cheese makes the cookies moist and rich
				but not greasy.
			</p>
			<p>
				Butter&apos;s nutty dairy flavor complements the tanginess of
				cream cheese.
			</p>
			<p>
				You know your butter is at the right temperature when you push
				the butter, and it makes an indent, but your finger doesn&apos;t
				easily squish right through.
			</p>

			<h3>Cream cheese</h3>
			<p>
				Cream cheese adds a unique tangy flavor to these cookies,
				complementing the chocolate and balancing the sweetness.
			</p>
			<p>
				Use brick-style cream cheese for this recipe, and be sure
				it&apos;s full-fat cream cheese.
			</p>
			<p>
				Because cream cheese has more moisture and a lower fat content
				than butter, it contributes to plumper cookies that are less
				prone to spreading.
			</p>
			<p>
				Additionally, the moisture from cream cheese helps these cookies
				stay moist and soft longer than the average chocolate chip
				cookies.
			</p>
			<p>

				<a href="/recipes/homemade-cream-cheese">easy recipe</a>.
			</p>

			<h3>Egg</h3>
			<p>
				The egg adds rich flavor to these cream cheese chocolate
				cookies. The yolk acts as an emulsifier to bind all ingredients
				evenly, and the egg white contributes to the softness.
			</p>
			<p>
				Eggs must always be at room temperature in baking unless
				specified otherwise. Here&apos;s
				<a href="/tips/how-to-warm-up-eggs-straight-from-the-fridge"
					>how to warm up eggs straight from the fridge</a
				>.
			</p>

			<h3>Dark brown sugar</h3>
			<p>
				Dark brown sugar adds moisture, giving these cookies a touch of
				caramel and irresistible gooeyness. It contains more molasses
				than light brown sugar, giving it a deeper flavor.
			</p>
			<p>
				Use our
				<a href="/recipes/homemade-brown-sugar"
					>Homemade Brown Sugar Recipe</a
				>
				to make your own!
			</p>

			<h3>Granulated sugar</h3>
			<p>
				Sugar tenderizes these cream cheese chocolate cookies by
				lessening the gluten formation.
			</p>
			<p>
				Additionally, sugar coats air bubbles to retain air, making
				cookies rise so the results are not dense.
			</p>

			<h3>Vanilla extract</h3>
			<p>
				Vanilla brings out the flavors of the other ingredients and adds
				warmth and a slight floral sweetness.
			</p>

			<h3>Bittersweet chocolate</h3>
			<p>
				Chunks of bittersweet chocolate bar (63–72% cocoa solids), with
				its pronounced flavor, is my go-to chocolate.
			</p>

			<h2 id="gemmas-pro-chef-tips">Gemma&apos;s Pro Chef Tips</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					If you don&apos;t have a fan (convection) oven, bake these
					cookies at 350°F (180°C) and either bake the pans one at a
					time or rotate them once or twice during baking.
				</li>
				<li>
					Note that these cookies stay pale on top but get very brown
					on the bottom. Be sure to check them towards the end of the
					baking time and pull them out before they burn.
				</li>
				<li>
					You can easily double this batch for a party or a bake sale!

			<h2 id="faqs">FAQs</h2>

			<h3>Can I make these cookies gluten-free?</h3>
			<p>
				Yes, you can make these cookies gluten-free, but note that they
				will differ in taste and texture from cookies made with the
				original recipe.
			</p>
			<p>
				Use a 1:1 all-purpose gluten-free flour blend or Almond Flour
				Baking Mix in place of the all-purpose wheat flour.
			</p>

			<h3>Is it possible to make these cookies egg-free?</h3>
			<p>
				Yes, you can make these cookies egg-free. Please see our
				<a href="/guides/12-best-egg-substitutes-for-baking"
					>12 Best Egg Substitutes for Baking</a
				>
				post for details: a flax egg is one option that would work well
				here.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you&apos;re looking for a vegan option, check out our
				<a href="/recipes/vegan-chocolate-chip-cookies"
					>Vegan Chocolate Chip Cookies</a
				>.
			</p>

			<h3>Could I substitute another ingredient for the cream cheese?</h3>
			<p>
				Yes. You can use an equal amount of mascarpone cheese (which
				will make your cookies slightly sweeter) or full-fat Greek
				yogurt (which will yield cookies that are cakier than cookies
				made with cream cheese).
