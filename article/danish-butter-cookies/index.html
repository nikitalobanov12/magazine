				In Ireland, gifting tins of biscuits and sweets during the
				holidays is a cherished tradition, and Danish butter cookies
				were always among them.
				<br />
				<br />
				I have fond memories of unwrapping the iconic blue tin and
				enjoying each buttery cookie by the fire in my childhood home.
				<br /><br />
				If you&apos;re making these cookies at home, here are my top
				tips: make sure your butter is well-softened and thoroughly
				creamed with the sugar—this helps create a smooth, pipeable
				dough.
				<br /><br />
				For best results, use a high-quality piping bag instead of a
				ziplock, as the dough can be a bit too firm for flimsy bags.

			<h3>What are Danish Butter Cookies</h3>
			<p>
				<strong>Danish Butter Cookies</strong> are a type of shortbread
				cookie known for their rich, buttery flavor and crisp texture.
				<br /><br />
				Often associated with holiday tins, they are simple yet elegant
				cookies that melt in your mouth.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Buttery and Crisp</strong> - Rich in butter for a
					delicate, crisp bite.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Vanilla Flavored</strong> - A light, sweet vanilla
					taste balances the richness.

				<li>
					<strong>Melt-in-Your-Mouth Texture</strong> - Known for
					their tender, airy crumb.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Iconic Holidar Treat</strong> - Often found in
					festive tins, perfect for sharing.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Danish Butter Cookies originated in Denmark and became widely
				popular in the 20th century, especially through brands like
				Royal Dansk, which packaged them in iconic blue tins.
				<br /><br />
				Once a homemade treat, they are now a holiday favorite, known
				for their rich flavor and delicate texture.

			<h2 id="recipe">Tools You Need</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Measuring cups and spoons</li>
				<li>Electirc mixer with a mixing bowl</li>
				<li>Or Stand mixer with a paddle attachment</li>
				<li>Piping bag with large star piping tip</li>
				<li>2 baking sheets</li>
				<li>Parchment paper or Silicone mat</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Key ingredients</h2>
			<h3>Butter</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Provides Richness, flavor, and a tender texture to the
					cookies
				</li>
				<li>
					I used a salted butter for extra flavors. Unsalted butter
					will also work
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Substitute</strong> Margarine or shortening can be
					used, but butter gives the best flavor and texture.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Granulated Sugar</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Adds sweetness and helps with the crisp texture.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Substitute:</strong> Powdered sugar or coconut sugar
					for a different sweetness profile.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Salt</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Balances the sweetness and enhances the overall flavor.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Egg</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Binds the ingredients together and helps with the structure
					of the cookie.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Substitute:</strong> No egg substitute can work the
					same as eggs in this recipe.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Vanilla Extract</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Pure vanilla extract adds a sweet, aromatic flavor that
					complements the butter.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Substitute:</strong> Vanilla bean paste will also
					work.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>All-Purpose Flour</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Provides structure and helps hold the dough together.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Substitute:</strong> Gluten-free flour blend or Easy
					Almond Flour Baking Mix for a gluten-free version.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Granulated Sugar (for topping)</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Adds a slight crunch and extra sweetness on top of the
					cookies.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Substitute:</strong> Colored sanding sugar for a
					festive touch.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>How to Make Danish Butter Cookies Recipe</h2>

			<h3>Prep</h3>
			<p>
				Preheat the oven to 325°F (165°C) Fan Assist and line 2 baking
				sheets with parchment paper.
			</p>

			<h3>Make Danish Butter Cookie Dough</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					With an electric hand mixer, cream the butter, sugar, and
					salt together on high speed until pale and fluffy, about 3
					minutes.
				</li>
				<li>Add the egg and vanilla, and beat until combined.</li>
				<li>
					On low speed, add the flour and mix until just combined and
					your dough is formed with the right consistency.
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>Shape Danish Cookie Dough</h3>
			<p>
				Scoop dough into a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip (9mm)
				and pipe 2-inch (5cm) circles onto the prepared baking sheets.
				Sprinkle each biscuit with the 2 tablespoons of granulated
				sugar.
			</p>

			<h3>Bake the Cookies</h3>
			<p>
				Bake the trays for about 15 minutes, or until the edges are
				light golden brown. Let cool completely on a wire rack before
				storing in an airtight container.
			</p>
			<p>
				Enjoy with a hot cup of coffee. These cookies can be stored at
				room temperature for up to 4 days.
			</p>


			<h2>Gemma&apos;s Pro Chef Tips For Making Danish Butter Cookies</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Keep an eye on the cookies while you are baking them. They
					should only be a very pale golden when they are done.
				</li>
				<li>
					These cookies make great gifts! Line a tin with paper
					cupcake liners and stack two or three cookies in each liner.
					It will look just like a classic tin of Danish butter
					cookies!
				</li>
				<li>
					The primary flavors in this cookie are butter and vanilla,
					so you&apos;ll want to use good quality ingredients!
				</li>
				<li>Use colored sanding sugar for a festive touch!</li>
				<li>
					You can dip these cookies into melted milk, dark, or white
					chocolate.
				</li>
				<li>
					Go big on homemade! Make them with homemade vanilla extract
					and handmade butter!
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Fun Variations</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Chocolate-dipped:</strong> After baking, dip the
					edges of the cookies in melted chocolate (e.g., dark, milk,
					or white chocolate) for an extra indulgent touch.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Sprinkle with festive sugars:</strong> Use colored
					sanding sugar or coarse sugar to add a sparkling, festive
					finish to your cookies, perfect for the holidays.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Coconut-flavored:</strong> Add shredded coconut to
					the dough or sprinkle it on top before baking for a tropical
					twist.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Lemon zest:</strong> Incorporate lemon zest into the
					dough for a refreshing citrus flavor that complements the
					buttery richness.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Almond variation:</strong> Add almond extract
					instead of vanilla for a nutty, aromatic version of the
					classic cookie.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Make Ahead and Storage Instructions</h2>

			<h3>Make-Ahead</h3>
			<p>
				You can prepare the cookie dough up to 2 days in advance. Simply
				wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to
				pipe and bake.
			</p>

			<h3>Storage</h3>
			<p>
				Once baked, store the Danish Butter Cookies in an airtight
				container at room temperature for up to 4 days.
			</p>
			<p>
				For longer storage, place them in a sealed container and freeze
				for up to 2 months. Let frozen cookies thaw at room temperature
				for about an hour before serving.
			</p>
			<p>
				For gifting, pack the cookies in a decorative tin or box. Check
				out my guide

            <h2>FAQ</h2>
			<h3>Why is my Danish Butter Cookies Dough Too Thick to Pipe?</h3>
			<p>
				If your Danish butter cookie dough is too thick or dry to pipe,
				here&apos;s how to fix it:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Add a tablespoon of milk to the dough and mix it in to
					soften the consistency.
				</li>
				<li>
					Check the dough texture—it should be smooth, soft, and easy
					to pipe. If it&apos;s still too thick, add a little more
					milk, but avoid making it too runny.
				</li>
				<li>
					Ensure proper mixing—sometimes the butter or flour can cause
					clumps, so make sure the dough is well-blended before adding
					any liquids.
				</li>
				<li>
					For best results, make sure you&apos;re using quality
					butter, as it helps create the right texture for piping.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Why Did My Danish Cookies Spread Out and Lose Their Shape?</h3>
			<p>
				If your Danish butter cookies are spreading too much while
				baking, it could be due to a few common issues:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Too much butter:</strong> Excess butter can cause
					the cookies to spread more than desired. Use a kitchen scale
					to measure the butter or ensure you&apos;re using the correct
					ratio of ingredients.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Overmixing the dough:</strong> Overmixing the dough
					can warm up the butter and make it too soft. Mix until just
					combined to prevent excess spreading.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Warm dough:</strong> If the dough is too warm when
					piped or placed on the baking sheet, it will spread more
					while baking. Try chilling the dough for 15-30 minutes
					before piping and baking.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Incorrect oven temperature:</strong> Ensure your
					oven is preheated to the correct temperature, and use an
					oven thermometer to make sure it&apos;s accurate. Too low a
					temperature can cause excessive spreading.
				</li>
			</ul>
